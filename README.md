# Analog Wall-Following Robot

This repository showcases our **Analog Wall-Following Robot**, a semester project designed and built during our university coursework. The robot operates entirely using analog components, without any microcontroller (MCU), highlighting the essence of pure analog circuit design.

## About the Project
- **Objective**: To design and develop a wall-following robot using only analog components that can efficiently follow a wall while maintaining a consistent distance.
- **Unique Approach**: Unlike conventional robots that rely on microcontrollers or digital processing, this project leverages analog circuits for sensing, control, and actuation.
- **Educational Focus**: Demonstrates the application of electronics principles, such as signal processing, sensor integration, and feedback control, in a real-world scenario.

## **Whatâ€™s Included**
- **Project Documentation**: Detailed reports, circuit diagrams, and schematics explaining the design and implementation.
- **Project Files**: All necessary materials, including component lists, PCB layouts, and calculations.
- **Our Journey**: Videos and images capturing the development, testing, and final demonstration of the robot.

## **Team Contributions**
This project is a collaborative effort by our dedicated team, where each member contributed to different aspects of the design, assembly, and testing.
